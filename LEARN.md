# Discrete Mathematics: Set Theory and Operations

In this guide, you will learn about Discrete Mathematics in set theory, set operations, and set properties.

## Set Theory

Set theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of sets, which are collections of objects. In set theory, we define a set as a well-defined collection of distinct objects. The objects in a set are called elements or members of the set.

## Set Operations

Set operations are operations that can be performed on sets to create new sets. The most common set operations are:

- Union
- Intersection
- Difference
- Symmetric Difference

### Union

The union of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that are in A, or in B, or in both. The union of A and B is denoted by A ∪ B.

### Intersection

The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that are in both A and B. The intersection of A and B is denoted by A ∩ B.

### Difference

The difference of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that are in A but not in B. The difference of A and B is denoted by A - B.

### Symmetric Difference

The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that are in A or in B, but not in both. The symmetric difference of A and B is denoted by A △ B.

## Set Properties

Sets have several properties that are important to understand. Some of the most common set properties are:

- Subset
- Superset
- Empty Set
- Universal Set
- Complement

### Subset

A set A is said to be a subset of another set B if all the elements of A are also elements of B. The subset relationship is denoted by A ⊆ B.

### Superset

A set A is said to be a superset of another set B if all the elements of B are also elements of A. The superset relationship is denoted by A ⊇ B.

### Empty Set

The empty set is the set that contains no elements. The empty set is denoted by ∅.

### Universal Set

The universal set is the set that contains all possible elements. The universal set is denoted by U.

### Complement

The complement of a set A is the set of all elements that are not in A. The complement of A is denoted by A'.
